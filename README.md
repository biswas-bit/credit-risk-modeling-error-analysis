## Loan Default Risk – Algorithm Comparison & Error Analysis

- Conducted end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, including missing value treatment, feature type segregation, leakage detection, and multicollinearity analysis.
- Performed a systematic **algorithm comparison** using BalancedRandomForest, Random Forest,catboost, and XGBoost on a highly imbalanced loan default dataset.
- Addressed class imbalance by applying **class weighting** and **decision threshold tuning**, prioritizing recall for the minority (default) class.
- Analyzed **false positive vs false negative trade-offs** to align model evaluation with real-world business risk in credit decision-making.
